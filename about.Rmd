### Bio

I am an educator dedicated to using data and evidence driven practices to improve students' learning outcomes around the world. During my five years of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) abroad, I recognized similar trends across countries which prevented learners from gaining a high-quality education. I returned to school and received a Masters in Education, where I focused on program evaluation in developing contexts. I have experience with conducting research in the areas of education technology, girls' education, and the future of work.
